# Foo Feature Implementation

## Goal

Build a comprehensive foo feature that integrates with the existing system architecture. This involves creating new API endpoints, updating the database schema, and implementing a responsive UI component.

Key objectives:
- Create RESTful API for foo resources
- Implement data validation and error handling
- Build React components for foo management
- Add unit and integration tests

## Current Status

Implementation is approximately 60% complete. The API layer is functional and the database migrations have been applied. Currently working on the frontend components and resolving some edge cases in the validation logic.

## Blockers

- Waiting on design review for the modal component
- Need clarification on pagination requirements for large datasets
